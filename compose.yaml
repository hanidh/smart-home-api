    # If your app requires ports to be exposed, add them here. For example:
    ports:

    # If your app requires a database or other services, add them below and set depends_on accordingly.

    #   - postgres
    # networks:
    #   - appnet

# If you add external services (e.g., a database), define them here. Example:
#  postgres:
#    image: postgres:latest
#    restart: unless-stopped
#    environment:
#      POSTGRES_USER: user
#      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password

#    networks:
#      - appnet

# Uncomment and define networks if you have multiple services that need to communicate
#networks:
#  appnet:
#    driver: bridge

# Uncomment and define volumes if you have persistent data (e.g., for databases)
